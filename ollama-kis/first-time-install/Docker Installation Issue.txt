Docker Installation Issue - Lenovo

If you're experiencing Docker issues on your Lenovo T430 and suspect that BIOS settings might be involved, here are a few BIOS settings you might need to check:

1. **Virtualization Technology (VT-x)**:
    - Ensure that Intel Virtualization Technology is enabled.
    - To do this, go to the BIOS setup (press "Enter" at the Lenovo logo, then "F1"), navigate to the `Security` tab, and then select `Virtualization`. Make sure the `Intel Virtualization Technology` option is enabled.

2. **I/O Virtualization (VT-d)**:
    - Similarly, ensure that Intel VT-d (Directed I/O) is enabled if your Docker setup requires it.
    - This setting can typically be found in the same `Security` tab under `Virtualization`.

3. **Secure Boot**:
    - Some Docker configurations might require disabling Secure Boot.
    - To check this, go to the BIOS setup, navigate to the `Security` tab, and then select `Secure Boot`. Make sure Secure Boot is disabled if Docker needs it.

4. **UEFI/Legacy Boot Mode**:
    - Ensure the boot mode matches your operating system's requirements (UEFI or Legacy).
    - Navigate to the `Startup` tab in the BIOS setup and check the `UEFI/Legacy Boot` setting.

### Steps to Access BIOS and Adjust Settings:

1. **Turn off your laptop** if it's currently on.
2. **Power on the laptop** by pressing the power button.
3. **Immediately start pressing the "Enter" key repeatedly** when the Lenovo logo appears on the screen.
4. **Press "F1"** to enter the BIOS setup.
5. **Navigate to the relevant tabs** (`Security` for Virtualization and Secure Boot, `Startup` for UEFI/Legacy Boot) and adjust the settings as needed.
6. **Save and exit** the BIOS by pressing `F10` and confirming your changes.

After adjusting the BIOS settings, restart your laptop and try running Docker again.
